rscaffold
---------
make a new ruby project.
rscaffold is a similar concept to jeweler, 
but is meant to be simpler and smaller.

Installation
---------

    git clone https://github.com/rscaffold
    cd rscaffold
    rake install

(use `sudo` as necessary)

Runtime Requirements
---------
ruby <%=@spec.required_ruby_version.to_s%>

Build Requirements
---------
rake

Inspiration and History
---------
I like automated setup of project scaffolding. 
I thought jeweler is a little too much.
